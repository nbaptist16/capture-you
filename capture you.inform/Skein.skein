You are known to be a highly-skilled female agent, and are therefore given the task of capturing the head of an organization that is threatening the people of Aerugo. Unfortuanately for you, Mr. Zakarius kind of-sort of lost your equipment on the way. After you and your teammate have successfully taken care of the entrance guards and picking the front door lock (and after you have successfully fumed for a full five minutes), you must make your way through  the temporary HQ to the center, where the boss is located.

Capture You
An Interactive Fiction by Nicole Baptist

Entrance
A petite room with black and white checkerboard-style tiles, and grey walls. There is a plant on either side of the doorway, and three narrow windows. The exit is to the north.

Together, you and Zakarius burst through the door into the boss&quot; room, and run to restrain him. (Fortunately for you, the guards are, apparently, still occupied.) The boss laughs (a rather disgusting laugh) and smiles. &quot;Ah, I knew the military&apos;d send someone for me someday...I just didn&apos;t expect you lot to find me so soon.&quot; You and Roy look at each other, remembering your mission: to bring Mr. Boss back alive for questioning.

What appears to be the guards` break room. A simple, clean room with a few tables and chairs for the base&apos;s security guards to rest on. There is a counter along the wall across the door. Apparently it is not break time yet. The exit is back south.

You can see Tables and Chairs here.
