How well does the game accomplish what you set out to do?
	It accomplishes everything I wanted to do and more (what with the little bits of humor). I am especially proud of how well the “drop the cake” puzzle went.

Discuss a time when you got stuck, and how you got unstuck.
	As I mentioned in the first answer, I got really stuck on the cake puzzle. Like, it took me days to figure out. There was a lot of trial and error. I got unstuck by asking a friend to help me.

Describe each of three puzzles in your game and how to solve each puzzle.
	So there are, actually, quite a few puzzles in my game…unfortunately, this question only requires three, so I’ll just repeat my answers submitted to canvas. My first puzzle is a combination puzzle, in which the player must know to combine a bit with a pin to make a key. My second puzzle is an information puzzle, where the player has to find the combination to unlock a locker. My last puzzle involves an unusual use of an object. For this puzzle, the player has to drop a piece of cake to get rid of the guards in the way.

Discuss the gameplay mechanics in your game and how they improve the user's experience.


Discuss the beta testing process: Who tested your game? 
	Riley and Dylan beta tested my game. Dylan caught quite a few grammatical errors, and Riley gave me a lot of great suggestions. Both of them really helped in making my game better.


How did their feedback affect your game? 
	My game is now free of any grammatical errors, and (as far as I’ve checked) everything works. No more glitches.


Whose game did you beta test? 
	I beta tested Riley’s game and Dylan’s. I also tried part of Jonathan’s game, but I didn’t really finish it in time, so I didn’t have any comments.


What feedback were you able to give?
	I was able to help out with finding synonyms, fixing spelling errors, and pointing out confusing parts in the games I tested.


What are you most proud of?
	I am most proud of my cake puzzle. I think I’ve mentioned this enough already, though.


What would you do differently next time?
I might make my game longer. Honestly, there are only fifteen commands needed to beat the game, and seven are directional commands.
